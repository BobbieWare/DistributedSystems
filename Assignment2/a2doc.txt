For this assignment I design a social media application. 

It allows users to do the following things:

Login using a username.
Make a post to the site.
View all posts made.
Like posts.
Unlike posts.

It contains the following pages:

index - the front pages users see
login - users enter a username and logs them in potentially adding them to the db
userhomepage - allows users to decide an action to take
newpost - users enter infomation for a new post to be created
newsfeed - shows all posts on the db and allows user to like or unlike the post

It contains the following servlets:

loginservice - validates login info and adds to db
logoutservie - removes data from session
likeservice - call on logic for liking and unlking
postservice - call on logic for making a post

It contains the following beans:

userbean - contains logic for adding, getting all, and getting usernames or userIDs from names or ids
postbean - contains logic for adding, getting all , and likeing or unliking posts
counterbean - a singleton bean which counts how many pages have been viewed from the app, also the user and post count

For this project please load in the assignment 2 application into NetBeans.

For the SQL data base I have included two file which can be used in netbeans to generate the required tables. 
These files are POSTS sql structure and USER sql structure.

The only other thing to be changed is the url for the database, this will be based off of whatever you will call 
the db that you create. This is needed to be changed at all location where dbURL is found.
